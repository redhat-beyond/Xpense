# Issues
### What can I work on
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See 
[Labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels) for more information. We assign issues to specific contributors, although you are more than welcome to open a PR with a fix if you find an issue to work on.

### Create a new issue
If you spot a problem/bug or think that some changes are needed , search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

### Issue template
• **Title**
  Must be clear, concise, and accurately describe what the issue is about.

• **Description**
  Must include a clear explanation about the reasons for doing the work. Preferably in the form of a user story
  that clearly mentions the stakeholders involved and their wishes.

• **Acceptance criteria**
  Must be a list of measurable achievements that indicate the work in the issue is done.

##### Issue reporting guidelines
•	 When describing issues try to phrase your issue in terms of the behavior you think needs changing rather than the code you think needs changing.

•	If reporting a bug, then try to include a pull request with a failing test case. This will help us quickly identify if there is a valid issue, and make sure that it gets fixed more quickly if there is one.

•	Closing an issue doesn't necessarily mean the end of a discussion. If you believe your issue has been closed incorrectly, explain why and we'll consider if it needs to be reopened.


### Reviewing PRs:
1. Always provide constructive feedback
2. Keep your ego out of code reviews
3. Be precise about what needs to be improved
4. Don't just hope for the code to work, Check it yourself!
5. Be strict about temporary code
6. Visualize the bigger picture
